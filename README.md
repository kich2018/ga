Genetic algorithm:
The code implements a genetic algorithm designed to evolve benzene-framed model structures by strategically assembling six building blocks from a pool of 30 genes, with the goal of optimizing redox potential. It generates XYZ files for 20 benzene-framed model compound chromosomes for each new generation. Redox potential serves as the fitness function to enhance the battery performance of these structures. The algorithm employs genetic operations, including elitism, mutation, and crossover, to drive the evolutionary process.

An input file named by "gen1_6value.txt" contains computed redox potentials of 20 randomly generated chromosomes in another input file named by "gen1_chromo_information.txt".  The code utilizes the two input files to evolve 20 chromosomes for the 2nd generation. This process produces the structure files of newly generated chromosomes and "gen2_chromo_information.txt" that has a same format as "gen1_chromo_information.txt". For the evolution of the 3rd generation, you need calculated redox potentials of the newly generated chromosomes that have to replace the values in "gen1_6value.txt" and the contents in "gen1_chromo_information.txt" has to be replaced by that in "gen2_chromo_information.txt".
