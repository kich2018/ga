Genetic algorithm:
The code implements a genetic algorithm designed to evolve benzene-framed model structures by strategically assembling six building blocks from a pool of 30 genes, with the goal of optimizing redox potential. It generates XYZ files for 20 benzene-framed model compound chromosomes for each new generation. Redox potential serves as the fitness function to enhance the battery performance of these structures. The algorithm employs genetic operations, including elitism, mutation, and crossover, to drive the evolutionary process.
